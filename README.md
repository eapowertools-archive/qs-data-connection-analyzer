# qs-data-connection-analyzer
The Qlik Sense Data Connection Analyzer is a Qlik application that parses script log files and queries the QRS API, allowing analysis of data connection usage, patterns, age, and cleanliness across a Qlik Sense site. In short, this app will help to run a leaner, more performant, and more easily and holistically governed Qlik Sense site.
